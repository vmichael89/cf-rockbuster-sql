## Most Intersting Finding

Upon delving into the data, I discovered that Rockbuster imposes a **$1 daily fee** for overdue rentals. Interestingly, these overdue charges contribute to **30% of the total revenue** due to short loan periods. This could raise ethical issues. Customers might argue that Rockbuster Stealth LLC intentionally sets shorter loan periods as a strategy to boost their revenue.
